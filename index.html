            <h2>Overview of Caste System</h2>
            <p>The caste system in Nepal is a social hierarchy that categorizes individuals into different groups based on their ancestry and occupation. It has its roots in Hinduism and has been a significant part of Nepalese society for centuries. The caste system traditionally consists of four main varnas or classes: Brahmins (priests and scholars), Kshatriyas (warriors and rulers), Vaishyas (merchants and traders), and Shudras (laborers and service providers). Below these varnas are the Dalits, historically known as "untouchables," who are considered outside the caste system and face severe social discrimination.</p>

            <h2>Types of Discrimination</h2>
            <p>Caste discrimination in Nepal manifests in various forms, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Access to Education:</strong> Dalit children often face discrimination in schools, leading to lower enrollment rates and higher dropout rates compared to children from higher castes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Employment:</strong> Dalits are often relegated to low-paying and menial jobs, facing discrimination in hiring and promotion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Social Status:</strong> Dalits are often treated as inferior and are subjected to social segregation and exclusion from certain public spaces and religious institutions.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Impact on Individuals and Communities</h2>
            <p>Caste discrimination has profound effects on individuals, families, and communities in Nepal. It perpetuates cycles of poverty and marginalization, limiting access to opportunities for education, employment, and social mobility. It also leads to a sense of social exclusion and psychological distress among those who experience discrimination.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Legal and Social Responses</h2>
            <p>In recent years, there have been efforts to address caste discrimination in Nepal through legal and social initiatives. The Nepalese government has enacted laws prohibiting caste-based discrimination and providing for affirmative action measures to promote the rights of Dalits. Social organizations and advocacy groups have also been working to raise awareness about caste discrimination and promote social inclusion.</p>

                <h3>Few more tragic story of love and inequality</h4>
                <p>In Baglung Galkot, a 19-year-old girl from a 'high caste family' fell in love with Prakash BK, a Dalit youth. Despite their deepening love, protests erupted from the girl's family. Determined to stay together, the couple eloped to Kathmandu.<br>

                    Facing relentless pressure from her family, the girl's mother's hurtful words pushed her over the edge. The next morning, she was found dead, unable to bear the pain of societal rejection.<br>
                    
                    In another tragic incident, a father in Bara killed his daughter for loving a Dalit youth. These stories reflect the harsh reality of caste-based discrimination in Nepal, where love often meets a tragic end at the hands of societal norms and prejudices.</p>
